2. **Follow the coding style** of the project
3. **Write clear commit messages**
4. **Include tests** for new features
5. **Update documentation** as needed

## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WebSiteOtakuShopVer2.git
cd WebSiteOtakuShopVer2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-user-profile` - New features
- `fix/login-bug` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/auth-logic` - Code refactoring
- `test/add-api-tests` - Adding tests

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
fix(api): resolve products endpoint timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(db): optimize database query performance
```

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
// Use TypeScript types
interface User {
  id: number
  email: string
  username: string
}

// Use const for variables that don't change
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'

// Use descriptive variable names
const userProfile = getUserProfile()

// Use async/await instead of promises
async function fetchUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
  return response.json()
}

// Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
/**
 * Authenticates a user with email and password
 * @param email - User's email address
 * @param password - User's password
 * @returns JWT token if successful
 */
async function login(email: string, password: string): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### React Components

```tsx
// Use functional components with TypeScript
interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void
  children: React.ReactNode
  disabled?: boolean
}

export function Button({ onClick, children, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      className="btn-primary"
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

// Use meaningful component names
export function UserProfileCard() {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### CSS/Tailwind

```tsx
// Use Tailwind utilities consistently
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Title</h2>
  <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
    Click me
  </button>
</div>
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

```

Always add tests for:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- API endpoints
- Utility functions
