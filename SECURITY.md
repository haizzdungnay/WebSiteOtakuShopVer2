# Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- [x] Secure password hashing using bcryptjs (10 rounds)
- [x] Token expiration (7 days default)
- [x] Bearer token authentication for API endpoints
- [x] Secure cookie configuration (httpOnly, sameSite: strict)

### CSRF Protection
- [x] CSRF token generation and validation
- [x] X-CSRF-Token header validation on state-changing requests
- [x] Token stored securely in cookies

### XSS Protection
- [x] Input sanitization for all user inputs
- [x] HTML special characters escaping
- [x] Content-Type validation
- [x] X-XSS-Protection header enabled
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header

### Security Headers
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] Permissions-Policy for camera, microphone, geolocation

### Database Security
- [x] Parameterized queries (prevents SQL injection)
- [x] Connection pooling for performance
- [x] Environment-based database credentials
- [x] Database connection timeout handling

### API Security
- [x] Authentication required for sensitive endpoints
- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] Error handling without exposing sensitive information
- [x] Rate limiting ready (can be implemented with middleware)

### Container Security
- [x] Multi-stage Docker builds
- [x] Non-root user in production containers
- [x] Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- [x] Environment variable based configuration
- [x] Separate containers for different services

### Data Protection
- [x] Passwords never stored in plain text
- [x] Sensitive data excluded from version control (.gitignore)
- [x] Environment variables for secrets
- [x] JWT secrets configurable via environment

## üîí Best Practices Implemented

### Code Security
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Modern React patterns (hooks, context)
- Server-side rendering for better security
- Input validation on both client and server

### Infrastructure Security
- Isolated Docker networks
- Health checks for services
- Proper volume management
- Service dependency management

### Development Security
- Separate development and production environments
- Environment variable templates (.env.example)
- Secure defaults with warnings to change in production
- Clear separation of concerns

## üìã Additional Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. Change all default secrets and passwords
2. Implement rate limiting middleware
3. Add API request logging and monitoring
4. Set up SSL/TLS certificates (HTTPS)
5. Configure CORS properly for your domain
6. Implement session management and refresh tokens
7. Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
8. Set up automated security scanning
9. Implement backup and disaster recovery
10. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Regular Security Maintenance
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Review and rotate secrets periodically
- Keep PostgreSQL and Docker images updated
- Review access logs regularly

### Testing Security
- Test authentication flows thoroughly
- Verify CSRF protection is working
- Test XSS prevention with malicious inputs
- Verify SQL injection protection
- Test authorization for different user roles
- Perform penetration testing before production

## üö® Security Warnings

### Important Notes
1. **JWT_SECRET**: MUST be changed in production to a strong, random value
2. **Database Passwords**: Use strong passwords in production
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit .env files to version control
5. **Error Messages**: Avoid exposing stack traces in production

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) instead of using the issue tracker.

## üîê Security Updates

This project uses GitHub Dependabot to automatically check for security updates in dependencies. Regular updates are recommended.
